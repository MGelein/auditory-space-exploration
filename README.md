# Auditory Space Exploration
Second project for the New Media New Technology course of Media Technology MSc. of Leiden University. This time the theme was 'SPACE', and the only requirement
was the usage of openFrameworks.

## The Idea
With SPACE as a theme, it makes sense to go for a outer space exploration phenomenon. This is however only the first layer. The second layer is the SPACE
key present on any keyboard. This key creates spaces in your written text, and thus will be used as the primary input for the application. If spaces in written
text are present, then they must be present in spoken text as well, which leads me to the third layer: silence as SPACE. 

When pressing the SPACEbar on the computer, a recording is started as long as the key is held down. In this recording SPACES, or silences are found
and marked as well as other metadata about the soundfile (such as average volume, length, etc). This is then taken as an input for
a multi-octave perlin-noise terrain generator who creates a planet in SPACE.

Everytime you start recording you fly through SPACE to another planet, which is then generated depending on how you sound.
